# Introduction

Before connecting to the deployments, you need to complete the required operations for Deployment Overview to obtain the necessary information such as the deployment hosting address and connection port. At the same time, you also need to add client connection authentication information in the EMQX Cloud console Authentication and ACL.

For the Standard Plan, EMQX Cloud provides TLS/SSL connection authentication by default. You may also need to download [root certificate](https://assets.emqx.com/data/cn.emqx.cloud-ca.crt) for TLS/SSL connection.

## Connect to Deployment

EMQX Cloud provides a variety of SDKs and client tools connection examples, you can go to [Connect to Deployment](../connect_to_deployments/overview.md) to learn more.
